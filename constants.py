    (
        "What kinds of things can I do with ViralVibes?",
        "ViralVibes is designed for analyzing YouTube playlists and surfacing insights. "
        "You can use it to track engagement, spot viral trends, compare creators, or run "
        "deep dives on specific niches. It works equally well for quick experiments, "
        "dashboards, research projects, or as part of a bigger content strategy.",
    ),
    (
        "Where can I deploy ViralVibes?",
        "ViralVibes is a Python-based web app. You can run it locally, or deploy it to "
        "services like Railway, Vercel, Hugging Face Spaces, Replit, or any VPS/server "
        "with Python installed. It's lightweight and runs on all major operating systems.",
    ),
    (
        "How is ViralVibes different from other analytics tools?",
        "Most analytics tools focus on generic stats. ViralVibes is built specifically for "
        "YouTube playlists â€” it digs into engagement rate, controversy score, likes vs "
        "dislikes, and audience sentiment in a way that off-the-shelf dashboards don't.",
    ),
    (
        "Does this only work for static reports, or can it be interactive?",
        "It's fully interactive. ViralVibes surfaces real-time insights, lets you explore "
        "data visually, and updates dynamically as you validate playlists. You're not just "
        "looking at static charts â€” you're exploring living data.",
    ),
    (
        "How accurate is the data?",
        "ViralVibes pulls data directly from YouTube's official API, ensuring accuracy. "
        "Results are cached for performance, so you might see a slight delay if a playlist "
        "was recently analyzed. You can always trigger a fresh analysis.",
